# IroCO2 🌱

**IroCO2** is a tool designed to help organizations estimate and reduce the carbon footprint of their cloud infrastructures. Developed by Ippon Technologies, IroCO2 enables organizations to measure their environmental impact and supports them in their ecological transition. The tool combines detailed technical data (when available) with extrapolations from reference studies to address data gaps. IroCO2 provides both a predictive estimate of infrastructure carbon emissions and ongoing tracking through an infrastructure scanner. Currently compatible with AWS services, IroCO2 will soon support other cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, OVH, and on-premise solutions.

This project is the main repository of the IroCO2 project. It contains general documentation and the installation instructions.

🏗️ **Important** 🏗️ This project is currently in development and is going open source as soon as possible. Some parts of documentation or code may not be up to date or missing for the moment.
