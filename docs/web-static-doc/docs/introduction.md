# Introduction

With IroCO2, simplify the estimation of your infrastructure's carbon footprint and accelerate its transformation towards a greener cloud. ðŸŒ±

## Vision

Our goal with IroCO2 is to provide a solution that simplifies the implementation of a GreenOps approach within your teams. 

The approach can be summarized in a few words: **Measure**, **Understand**, **Act**. 
IroCO2 aims to estimate or measure the carbon footprint of your solutions
and provide analysis and advice on potential reductions.
These analyses will enable you to define a GreenOps strategy, implement it within your teams and infrastructure, and finally monitor its implementation on a daily basis on IroCO2.

IroCO2 does not aim to provide a tool for measuring carbon emissions with precision. 
The value of our solutions lies in the ability to compare estimates according to technical configuration changes on an infrastructure, and thus to seek a reduction in carbon footprint.
